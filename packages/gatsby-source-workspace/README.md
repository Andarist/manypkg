> Add information about worksapces in a monorepo to gatsby

This package is a stepping-stone package, providing the most important bits of information in a monorepo
directly through to you in the graphql.

We suspect that after this, you will want to generate pages for your packages, but we don't want to tell
you what to do.

We will likely recommend some more opinionated extensions of this that use the data to create pages.

The most likely are a plugin to run after this that create pages for:

- the main `README.md`
- the `CHANGELOG.md`
